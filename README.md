# JARVIS - Python Voice Assistant

## About This Project
JARVIS is a Python-powered voice assistant inspired by AI personal assistants. It can recognize your voice commands, respond verbally, and perform automated tasks such as opening websites (YouTube, Google, GitHub, Gmail, Stack Overflow). Built with `speech_recognition` and `pyttsx3`, this project demonstrates practical applications of Python for speech interaction, automation, and real-time AI-assisted control.

**Key Highlights:**
- Wake-word detection for activation (“JARVIS”).
- Command confirmation with voice feedback.
- Beep notification to indicate readiness.
- Modular and easily extensible for future AI integrations.
